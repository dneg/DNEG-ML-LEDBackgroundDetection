# All Component Config classes must have the @dataclass decorator. A Python dataclass defines fields (type-annotated
# variables). DNEG ML Toolkit uses this structure to expose the fields to the JSON system, mapping and type-validating
# JSON values into Component Config objects.
# Note that all components must have a correctly implemented Config class, even if it does not define any fields. The
# configuration system uses the structure and naming conventions of the Config class and corresponding Component
# class to create the Components when the system is being initialized.
# Fields are inherited from the parent Config class, so a Component may have more configuration and fields with
# default values that can be customized.
