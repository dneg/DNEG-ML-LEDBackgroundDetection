    # Normally, this type of field would not be flagged as optional, as it is a required value to initialize the
    # Network, and we would want the JSON validation to raise an error if it was not configured.
    # However, if using the ClassificationTrainModule, this field will be set automatically after the JSON
    # validation is performed, so flagging it as optional allows the validation to succeed in the case where we don't
    # give it a value in the JSON. If we are not using the ClassificationTrainModule
    # (i.e. using the StandardTrainModule from the core Toolkit), failing to configure
    # this field in the JSON will not raise a validation error as we would normally want. To solve this, the
    # Network component asserts that this value is not None at the start of its constructor.
